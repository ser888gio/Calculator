Secure Web Calculator

This innovative web calculator prioritizes security. It avoids the eval function and instead utilizes a robust algorithm: The Yard Shunting Algorithm. This approach transforms expressions from postfix (user input) to infix notation (standard mathematical format) for secure evaluation.

Key Features:

    Enhanced Security: Eliminates risks associated with the eval function.
    Multi-Digit Support: Accepts numbers built from multiple digits using a tokenizer.

This project demonstrates the implementation of secure and efficient calculation methods for web applications.
